# Unified Contact Management UI Design

## Overview

The Unified Contact Management UI is a comprehensive interface for managing all contact types within the EMMA platform. This design leverages the existing Resource Management UI foundation while extending it to support all relationship states: Clients, Prospects, Leads, ServiceProviders, and Agents.

## Design Principles

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show complexity only when needed based on relationship type
- **Adaptive UI**: Components adjust based on `RelationshipState` and context
- **Unified Data Model**: Single Contact entity with contextual panels
- **Industry Agnostic**: Configurable for different verticals (Real Estate, Insurance, etc.)
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for future contact types and workflows

## Core Components

### ContactList Component

**Purpose**: Universal contact directory with relationship-based filtering

**Features**:

- Adaptive filtering by RelationshipState
- Universal search across all contact types
- Bulk operations (export, import, delete, tag)
- Customizable columns based on relationship type
- Performance optimized for large contact lists

### ContactDetail Component

**Purpose**: Comprehensive contact view with contextual information

**Features**:

- Progressive disclosure based on relationship complexity
- Contextual panels that appear based on RelationshipState
- Interaction history timeline
- Communication tools (email, SMS, call logging)
- Document management and file attachments

### ContactForm Component

**Purpose**: Create and edit contacts with relationship-specific fields

**Features**:

- Dynamic form fields based on RelationshipState
- Industry-specific field configurations

- Conversion probability and next actions
- Marketing attribution and source tracking
- Automated follow-up scheduling

### LeadPanel

**Triggers**: RelationshipState = Lead

**Content**:

- Quick qualification forms and assessments
- Lead assignment and routing status
- Response time tracking and optimization
- Lead-to-prospect conversion workflows
- Source attribution and campaign tracking

### ResourcePanel

**Triggers**: RelationshipState = ServiceProvider

## UI Workflows

### Contact Creation Workflow

1. **Initial Contact Type Selection**
   - User selects relationship type (Client, Prospect, Lead, ServiceProvider, Agent)
   - Form adapts to show relevant fields for selected type
   - Industry-specific fields appear based on organization profile

2. **Basic Information Entry**
   - Standard contact fields (name, email, phone, address)
   - Relationship-specific required fields
   - Optional fields with progressive disclosure

3. **Contextual Information**
   - Relationship-specific panels appear
   - Industry customizations applied
   - Validation rules enforced per contact type

4. **Confirmation and Next Actions**
   - Contact created with appropriate RelationshipState
   - Suggested next actions based on contact type
   - Integration with workflows and automation

### Contact Conversion Workflow

**Purpose**: Convert contacts between relationship states (e.g., Lead → Prospect → Client)

**Process**:

1. **Conversion Trigger**
   - Manual conversion by user
   - Automated conversion based on business rules
   - Workflow-triggered conversion events

2. **Data Migration**
   - Preserve existing contact data
   - Add new fields required for target relationship state
   - Archive previous relationship-specific data

3. **Workflow Activation**
   - Activate new relationship-specific workflows
   - Deactivate previous workflows if applicable
   - Update automation rules and triggers

4. **Notification and Tracking**
   - Notify relevant team members
   - Log conversion in interaction history
   - Update analytics and reporting
