# EMMA AI-First CRM: Unified Project Management Plan

> **This master plan unifies implementation backlog, sprint plans, validation, technical debt, and enhancement tracking—so the team has one canonical view for delivery, review, and evolution.**

---

## 1. Project Structure & Documentation Flow

- **Master Backlog**: All implementation themes and priorities across sprints (see Section 2).
- **Sprint Summaries**: Validate sprint completion and document key outcomes (see Section 3).
- **Validation Checklists**: Used at the end of each sprint for completeness and production readiness.
- **Enhancement/Tech Debt Backlog**: “Later” and tech debt items tracked for grooming, with triggers to elevate based on product maturity, regulatory needs, or scale.
- **Migration Guide**: Ensures migrations are repeatable and documented as schema evolves.

---

## 2. Unified Implementation Backlog

### 2.1 Core Backlog by Sprint

#### **SPRINT 1: Core Architectural Hooks**
- Dynamic Agent Registry (`IAgentRegistry`)
- AgentOrchestrator dynamic routing (via registry, not hardcoded)
- Universal explainability (`Reason`, `AuditId`)
- Agent lifecycle hooks (hot reload, health)
- Feature flag infrastructure (config, code, runtime)
- Context provider abstraction (data access)
- API versioning (`/api/v1/` everywhere)

#### **SPRINT 2: Service Foundation, Monitoring, Extensibility**
- Agent Metadata Registry (DB model, API)
- Blueprint CRUD service (for agent blueprints)
- Real-time metrics and monitoring (Prometheus, App Insights)
- Security validation for factory agents (extends 3-tier validation)
- Human-in-the-loop approval queue
- Extensible action types/scopes (config/registration, not code)

#### **SPRINT 3: Three-Tier Validation, Optimization**
- Tag all actions by scope (InnerWorld/Hybrid/RealWorld)
- Optimize validation for inner-world actions (schema-only, cache)
- Validation metrics dashboard (real-time monitoring)
- Performance improvements and test coverage

#### **SPRINT 4: Agent Factory & Production Readiness**
- Agent compiler service (blueprint → executable agent)
- Hot-reload infrastructure (live update, zero downtime)
- Advanced monitoring & alerting
- Security hardening (RBAC, input validation, audit logs)

---

### 2.2 Enhancement & Tech Debt Backlog

#### Later Priority Items
- Null-safe accessors for `userOverrides`
- RegulatoryContext/ComplianceTags (for financial, healthcare, legal, etc)
- Enforce max batch size for bulk approval
- Audit schema snapshots for regression/migration
- Compliance tags/filters for audit logs and validation
- Document/enforce all default parameter behaviors
- Propagate compliance/industry tags in validation
- Add telemetry/event hooks for audit/monitoring
- Complete hardcoded demo values and stubs (see TECH_DEBT.md)

#### Tech Debt – Immediate Focus
- Security & access control (replace all hardcoded logic)
- Fix interface mismatches (e.g., NbaContextService)
- Remove or document all legacy/compatibility tags and secrets

  - **Dependencies:**  
    None currently identified.
  - **Status:** Proposed
  - **Notes:**  
    Consider potential impacts on existing workflows and ensure thorough testing.
- [2025-06-12] Ensure Consistent Logging in AgentOrchestrator
  - **Type:** Enhancement
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Owner:** Backend Team
  - **Related Area:** Logging, Monitoring
  - **Description:**  
    Review and update logging across all methods in `AgentOrchestrator` to ensure consistency and provide adequate context for debugging.
  - **Dependencies:**  
    None currently identified.
  - **Status:** Proposed
  - **Notes:**  
    Align with logging standards and best practices.
- [2025-06-12] Review Error Handling in AgentOrchestrator
  - **Type:** Tech Debt
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Owner:** Backend Team
  - **Related Area:** Error Handling, Robustness
  - **Description:**  
    Review error handling in `AgentOrchestrator` to ensure all potential exceptions are caught and logged appropriately.
  - **Dependencies:**  
    None currently identified.
  - **Status:** Proposed
  - **Notes:**  
    Ensure error messages are informative and actionable.

## 3. Validation & Success Criteria

- **Core Components:**
  - Dynamic agent registry is thread-safe, fully tested
  - Agent lifecycle management covers hot-reload, health
  - Explainability (`Reason`, `AuditId`) in all major models
  - Feature flags for all new capabilities; off by default
  - Context provider abstracts all data access
  - All APIs versioned
- **Quality Gates:**
  - Interface-driven, async code throughout
  - DI (Dependency Injection) best practices
  - Microsoft/Azure compliance & best practices
  - End-to-end integration and unit tests (target: 85%+ code coverage)
- **Operational/Monitoring:**
  - Structured logs, health endpoints, and metrics dashboards live
  - Rollback and deployment strategies defined and tested
- **Security:**
  - Input validation, audit logs, and RBAC in place for all new features

---

## 4. Documentation, Testing, and Migration

- **Docs**: All architecture, API, and implementation docs are in `/docs` per the README and Sprint summaries.
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests tracked with each sprint checklist and validated at release.
- **Migrations**: [MIGRATION-README.md](./MIGRATION-README.md) used for all DB/data schema changes—update and reference in PRs.

---

## 5. Change Management & Review Process

- **Enhancement backlog** ([TODO-ENHANCEMENT-BACKLOG.md](./TODO-ENHANCEMENT-BACKLOG.md)) reviewed monthly for promotion to current sprint.
- **Tech debt** ([TECH_DEBT.md](./TECH_DEBT.md)) reviewed after every sprint.
- **Sprint validation** checklists ([SPRINT-1-VALIDATION-CHECKLIST.md](./SPRINT-1-VALIDATION-CHECKLIST.md), etc.) signed off before prod deployment.
- **Migration guide** updated for every schema change.
