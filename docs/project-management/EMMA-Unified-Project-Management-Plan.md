# EMMA AI-First CRM: Unified Project Management Plan

> **This master plan unifies implementation backlog, sprint plans, validation, technical debt, and enhancement tracking—so the team has one canonical view for delivery, review, and evolution.**

---

## 1. Project Structure & Documentation Flow

- **Master Backlog**: All implementation themes and priorities across sprints (see Section 2).
- **Sprint Summaries**: Validate sprint completion and document key outcomes (see Section 3).
- **Validation Checklists**: Used at the end of each sprint for completeness and production readiness.
- **Enhancement/Tech Debt Backlog**: "Later" and tech debt items tracked for grooming, with triggers to elevate based on product maturity, regulatory needs, or scale.
- **Migration Guide**: Ensures migrations are repeatable and documented as schema evolves.

---

## 2. Unified Implementation Backlog

### 2.1 Core Backlog by Sprint

#### **SPRINT 1: Core Architectural Hooks**

- Dynamic Agent Registry (`IAgentRegistry`)
- AgentOrchestrator dynamic routing (via registry, not hardcoded)
- Universal explainability (`Reason`, `AuditId`)
- Agent lifecycle hooks (hot reload, health)
- Feature flag infrastructure (config, code, runtime)
- Context provider abstraction (data access)
- API versioning (`/api/v1/` everywhere)

#### **SPRINT 2: Service Foundation, Monitoring, Extensibility**

- Agent Metadata Registry (DB model, API)
- Blueprint CRUD service (for agent blueprints)
- Real-time metrics and monitoring (Prometheus, App Insights)
- Security validation for factory agents (extends 3-tier validation)
- Human-in-the-loop approval queue
- Extensible action types/scopes (config/registration, not code)

#### **SPRINT 3: Three-Tier Validation, Optimization**

- Tag all actions by scope (InnerWorld/Hybrid/RealWorld)
- Optimize validation for inner-world actions (schema-only, cache)
- Validation metrics dashboard (real-time monitoring)
- Performance improvements and test coverage

#### **SPRINT 4: Agent Factory & Production Readiness**

- Agent compiler service (blueprint → executable agent)
- Hot-reload infrastructure (live update, zero downtime)
- Advanced monitoring & alerting
- Security hardening (RBAC, input validation, audit logs)
- Organization subscription management
- User subscription assignments
- Seat management and enforcement

## 🚩 First Working Dev Release (MVP) – Milestone

### **Goal:**

Deliver a vertically-integrated, minimal EMMA workflow—demonstrating real-world agent orchestration, contact lifecycle, and end-to-end audit/compliance in a single deployable environment.

### **MVP Must-Have Features**

- **Contact CRUD & Ownership:**
  - Create, update, and delete a contact (agent as owner, with basic relationship fields).
  - Enforce ownership/assignment rules; real (not stubbed) access control.
- **Subscription Management:**
  - Basic subscription plan creation and management
  - User assignment to organization subscriptions
  - Seat limit enforcement and validation
  - Subscription status tracking and validation
- **Agent-Orchestrated Workflow:**
  - Trigger and execute a core workflow (e.g., contact follow-up, action recommendation).
  - Use dynamic agent registry and orchestrator (no hardcoded logic).
  - Basic LLM/NLP-based "next action" or intent recommendation.
- **Validation & Audit:**
  - Three-tier validation pipeline (with action scope classification).
  - Universal explainability: `Reason` and `AuditId` fields present and populated.
  - End-to-end audit trail for all major events (action, validation, override, subscription changes).
- **API Versioning & Feature Flags:**
  - All APIs versioned (`/api/v1/`), feature flags protecting all new functionality.
- **Minimal UI (Optional):**
  - A web form or API client to exercise core flows (add contact, manage subscriptions, trigger workflow, view audit).

### **Validation/Acceptance Checklist**

- [ ] Contact create/update/delete working via API and/or UI
- [ ] Only the assigned agent can access/edit their contacts (no stubbed access control)
- [ ] Can trigger workflow, LLM agent responds with suggested next action or summary
- [ ] All actions go through validation, return a populated Reason and AuditId
- [ ] Every workflow step generates an audit event
- [ ] Feature flags can enable/disable MVP features without breaking base system
- [ ] All APIs are accessed via `/api/v1/`
- [ ] Subscription management endpoints are secured and validated
- [ ] Seat limits are enforced across all relevant operations
- [ ] Subscription changes are properly audited
- [ ] Code passes unit/integration tests; minimal regression from prior releases
- [ ] Deployment guide and onboarding doc updated with subscription management

---

## 🛠️ Tech Debt – Immediate Focus (Deduplicated & Actionable)

**All high/medium-priority open technical debt items, deduplicated from historical docs, for ongoing tracking and sprint prioritization.**

### **Security & Access Control (Highest Priority)**

- [ ] Implement subscription validation in all API endpoints
- [ ] Add subscription status checks to critical workflows
- [ ] Ensure proper audit logging for subscription changes
- [ ] Implement role-based access control for subscription management

- [ ] Replace all hardcoded contact access logic (`ValidateContactAccessAsync` must enforce real ownership/collaboration).
- [ ] Implement real tenant validation and access checks (remove `IsActive=true`, hardcoded tenant IDs).
- [ ] Move consent/preferences from stubs to real user data (contact profile, consent management).
- [ ] Remove any legacy secrets/config from docker-compose files—move to secure Azure Key Vault or appsettings.

### **Core Functionality & Data Integrity**

- [ ] Fix interface mismatch in `NbaContextService` vs `ISqlContextExtractor` (ensure signature alignment and actual context extraction).
- [ ] Populate recent interactions, tasks, agent KPIs, and all reporting fields with live (not placeholder) data in SqlContextExtractor/AdminContextExtractor.
- [ ] Implement real system health monitoring (no more hardcoded "DatabaseStatus = Healthy", etc.).

### **Legacy Code & Migrations**

- [ ] Remove or migrate legacy privacy/business tags from Contact entities (`CRM`, `PERSONAL`, `PRIVATE`).
- [ ] Ensure all technical debt related to consent management, audit logging, and stubs is reflected in the master data migration plan.

### **Logging, Audit, Monitoring**

- [ ] Review and unify logging throughout AgentOrchestrator and major services (all logs consistent, actionable, and linked to AuditId).
- [ ] Add missing audit logging to all endpoints/methods where user or system actions occur.
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling and exception capture across all major services (no silent failures).

### **Documentation & Developer Experience**

- [ ] Update all outdated references and onboarding guides to point to this unified plan.
- [ ] Create/maintain a "Tech Debt Detail" appendix in this file (optional: if you want to preserve rationale/history for each item).
