# EMMA Unified Engineering Backlog  
*AI-First & Agent Factory Future-Proofing*

## Priority 1: Critical Architectural Hooks (Immediate, 1–2 weeks)
Lay the minimum foundation to safely accelerate future Agent Factory, AI-first, and validation upgrades with zero production risk.

### 1.1 Agent Registry & Dynamic Routing
- **Goal:** Dynamic agent registration/discovery via `IAgentRegistry`; refactor `AgentOrchestrator` to use the registry.
- **How:** 
  - Implement `IAgentRegistry` (see [AGENT-FACTORY-FUTURE-PROOFING-ANALYSIS.md]).
  - Refactor orchestrator to always use registry for agent invocation.
  - Feature flag dynamic routing; keep existing logic as fallback for now.
- **Success:** All agent types can be registered, listed, and invoked dynamically; no hardcoded references remain.

### 1.2 Lifecycle, Explainability, API Versioning, Feature Flags
- **Goal:** Add lifecycle hooks, universal `Reason` field, `/api/v1/` versioning, and feature flag infra.
- **How:** 
  - Implement agent lifecycle (`OnStart`, `OnReload`, `OnHealthCheck`, `OnStop`).
  - Add `Reason` to all API responses.
  - Version all API endpoints.
  - Add/expand config-driven feature flag infra.
- **Success:** New features are isolated, explainable, and forward-compatible.

### 1.3 Context Provider Abstraction
- **Goal:** Abstract all data access through `IContextProvider`.
- **How:** Refactor data layer for pluggable context provider.
- **Success:** Data source changes become low-risk, hot-swappable.

## Priority 2: Data Model & Service Extensions (2–3 weeks)
Lightweight stubs and enhanced metadata for rapid, safe expansion.

### 2.1 Agent Blueprint Stub & CRUD
- **Goal:** Implement basic `AgentBlueprintStub` and in-memory `IBlueprintService` CRUD.
- **How:** See [AGENT-FACTORY-IMPLEMENTATION-SPEC.md].
- **Success:** Create/list/edit blueprints via code or API.

### 2.2 Enhanced Action & Audit Metadata
- **Goal:** Extend action models with origin agent, blueprint IDs, compliance flags, audit fields.
- **How:** Schema updates to `ScheduledAction`, `ActionValidationResult`, etc.
- **Success:** All actions/audits can be traced to their agent and blueprint origin.

### 2.3 Null-Safe Accessors & ComplianceTags
- **Goal:** Add extension methods for null-safe userOverrides access; add regulatory fields (ComplianceTags, IndustryProfile).
- **How:** Helper methods + model tweaks.
- **Success:** Reduced boilerplate, fewer nulls, ready for regulated industries.

---

## Priority 3: Service, Compilation, and Validation Stubs (3–4 weeks)
Plug-and-play interfaces for rapid Agent Factory bootstrapping.

### 3.1 Blueprint & Compiler Stubs
- **Goal:** Implement stubs for `IBlueprintService`, `IAgentCompiler`, and core interfaces.
- **How:** Signature-only methods, in-memory or dummy returns for now.
- **Success:** Easy to implement real logic later without refactoring core.

### 3.2 Enhanced Validation & Security Extensions
- **Goal:** Expand three-tier validation to treat factory agents as first-class (risk scoring, override paths, etc).
- **How:** Update validator for `IsFactoryGenerated`/blueprint links; stub advanced checks.
- **Success:** Factory and core agents validated and secured equally.

### 3.3 Monitoring, Metrics, Telemetry Hooks
- **Goal:** Start basic Prometheus/AppInsights metric interface for agent/factory ops.
- **How:** Minimal interface, log or in-memory export for now.
- **Success:** All future monitoring can bolt on easily.

---

## Priority 4: Three-Tier Validation & Core Enhancements (4–6 weeks)
Production-grade validation, audit, and advanced monitoring.

### 4.1 Action Scope Tagging & Performance Optimization
- **Goal:** Tag all actions by scope; optimize “InnerWorld” action validation.
- **Success:** 10x faster validation for low-risk ops; dashboard metrics enabled.

### 4.2 Audit Trail, Compliance Logging, Documentation
- **Goal:** Complete audit logging for agent/action/override events (including userOverride details).
- **How:** Log at all validation/approval/override touchpoints.
- **Success:** Enterprise/compliance-grade traceability.

---

## Priority 5: Incremental UI/UX and "Later" Enhancements (Sprint 5+)
- Regulatory/compliance fields: Add as you enter new verticals.
- Bulk approval limits: For scale/performance.
- Null-safe accessors/dev docs: As codebase/team grows.
- Audit schema snapshots: For CI/CD & migrations.
- Monitoring/event hooks: Expand as usage grows.

---

## Implementation Tips
- **Feature-flag everything:** Toggle all new/factory/AI features.
- **Stub first, replace later:** Prefer interfaces and minimal stubs.
- **Centralize metadata/config:** Avoid hardcoding agent/action/blueprint properties.
- **Document as you go:** Link all new work to `MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-BACKLOG.md`.

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Agents are dynamically registered/discoverable.
- [ ] No hardcoded agent logic in orchestrator.
- [ ] All new features behind feature flags.
- [ ] All action/audit events include origin, reason, and trace.
- [ ] Blueprint CRUD and factory metrics are testable (even with in-memory stubs).
- [ ] Three-tier validation and context-provider abstraction in use for all validation.
