- **IX_Interactions_Type_Status**: Composite index on Type and Status

## Common Queries

### Get Contact with Recent Interactions

```csharp
var contact = await _context.Contacts
    .Include(c => c.Interactions.OrderByDescending(i => i.Timestamp).Take(10))
    .Include(c => c.OwnerAgent)
    .FirstOrDefaultAsync(c => c.Id == contactId);
```

### Get Interactions for Time Period

```csharp
var interactions = await _context.Interactions
    .Where(i => i.OrganizationId == organizationId && 
               i.Timestamp >= startDate && 
               i.Timestamp <= endDate)
    .OrderByDescending(i => i.Timestamp)
    .ToListAsync();
```

### Get Active Clients

```csharp
var activeClients = await _context.Contacts
    .Where(c => c.OrganizationId == organizationId && 
               c.IsActiveClient &&
               c.RelationshipState == RelationshipState.Client)
    .OrderBy(c => c.LastName)
    .ThenBy(c => c.FirstName)
    .ToListAsync();
```

### AuditEvents

Non-PII audit trail for irreversible actions like hard delete.

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Id | Guid | Yes | Primary key |
| OrganizationId | Guid | Yes | Owning organization |
| ActorUserId | Guid? | No | User who performed the action |
| Action | string | Yes | Event action (e.g., ContactErased) |
| OccurredAt | DateTime | Yes | Timestamp (UTC) |
| TraceId | string? | No | Correlation id |
| DetailsJson | jsonb? | No | Optional non-PII payload |

Indexes: OrganizationId, OccurredAt, Action

## Data Retention Policies

### Contacts

- Retained indefinitely unless deleted by user
- Archive implemented via `IsArchived` (reversible)
- Hard delete performs immediate erasure of PII across the contact graph; only non-PII `AuditEvent` remains

### Interactions

- Retained for 7 years for compliance
- Archived after 1 year
- Permanently deleted after retention period

## Schema Change Management

### Versioning

- Major version changes for breaking changes
- Minor version for additive changes
- Patch version for documentation updates

### Change Log

#### 1.1.1 (2025-09-15)

- ADR-0009: EF model sync to resolve drift without destructive changes.
  - Clarified concurrency token mapping: `RowVersion` remains non-nullable and is treated as a DB-managed row version (IsRowVersion) across entities.
  - Cleaned up FK mapping on `EmailAddresses` to ensure relationship binds to `ContactId` (removed shadow `ContactId1`).
  - Preserved audit column mapping by binding `DeletedById` to legacy column name `DeletedByUserId` (no column drop).
  - No functional entity shape changes; this is a safe-sync of mappings and snapshot.

#### 1.1.0 (2025-08-13)

- Added Organization entity fields (OrgGuid, Email, OwnerUserId, PlanType, SeatCount)
- Added OrganizationInvitation entity and relationships
- Documented user verification fields and endpoint

#### 1.0.0 (2025-06-14)

- Initial schema documentation
- Added Contact and Interaction entities
- Documented relationships and indexes
