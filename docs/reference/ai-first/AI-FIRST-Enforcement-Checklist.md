## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ AI as Afterthought
```csharp
// BAD: Traditional endpoint with AI "sprinkled on"
public async Task<IActionResult> GetContacts()
{
    var contacts = await _service.GetContactsAsync();
    // Maybe add some AI suggestions as a side feature
    return Ok(contacts);
}
```

### ✅ AI-First Design
```csharp
// GOOD: AI-driven with traditional fallback
public async Task<IActionResult> Ask(string query)
{
    var aiResponse = await _orchestrator.ProcessRequestAsync(query);
    if (aiResponse.RequiresTraditionalFallback)
    {
        return await HandleTraditionalRequest(aiResponse.ParsedIntent);
    }
    return Ok(aiResponse);
}
```

### ❌ Hardcoded Business Logic
```csharp
// BAD: Static rules that can't adapt
if (contact.LastContactDate < DateTime.Now.AddDays(-30))
{
    return "Send follow-up email";
}
```

### ✅ AI-Driven Logic
```csharp
// GOOD: Context-aware AI recommendations
var context = await _contextBuilder.BuildContextAsync(contactId);
var recommendation = await _nbaAgent.GetRecommendationAsync(context);
return recommendation;
```
