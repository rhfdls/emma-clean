Got the ZIP—thanks. I pulled everything apart and cross-checked the reference docs against each other and against what you told me is already merged. Here’s the punchy summary, plus what I saved to memory so we don’t lose the thread.

# What I updated in memory (high-signal only)

* Backend is now aligned with the onboarding flow:

  * `OrganizationCreateDto` (Name, Email, OwnerUserId); `OrgGuid` generated server-side.
  * RBAC policy `OrgOwnerOrAdmin` on invite endpoints.
  * `VerificationController` with `POST /api/auth/verify-email` → **204**.
  * `IEmailSender` + `EmailSenderDev` wired and used by `RegisterFromInvitation`.
* Docs updated: `AppDbContextSchema.md` (v1.1) and `EMMA-DATA-DICTIONARY.md` include `OrganizationInvitation`, verification fields, and **OwnerUserId**.
* Still to do: minimal frontend (`/join/[token]`, `/onboarding/verify`, `/contacts/new`), E2E tests, `VERIFY_URL_BASE` in README/.env, and broaden docs coverage (Unified Schema & Data Contract).

(✅ I saved this to memory so future steps stay consistent.)

# Consistency & contradictions check (from your ZIP)

**Consistent**

* `OwnerUserId` (not OwnerAgentId) appears in the updated reference docs.
* `OrganizationInvitation` is documented with token/expiry and ties to verification.
* Verification endpoint and fields (`VerificationToken`, `IsVerified`) appear in `AppDbContextSchema.md` with **204** status.

**Inconsistencies / gaps**

1. **Unified Schema (architecture/UNIFIED\_SCHEMA.md)**

   * Does **not** include `OrganizationInvitation` or user-verification attributes yet.
   * Action: add those entities/fields to keep the canonical schema in sync.

2. **Data Contract (reference/DATA\_CONTRACT.md)**

   * Current file covers **Interactions**, not the org/invite/verify contracts you just implemented.
   * Action: extend with:

     * `POST /api/organization` (create)
     * `POST /api/organization/{orgId}/invitations`
     * `GET /api/organization/invitations/{token}`
     * `POST /api/organization/invitations/{token}/register`
     * `POST /api/auth/verify-email` (204)

3. **Terminology drift: “Conversation” vs “Interaction”**

   * Multiple docs (e.g., AI Architecture Guide) still use `Conversation` + `ConversationId` in examples. Your system standard is clearly **Interaction**.
   * Action: global doc sweep to rename to **Interaction / InteractionId** (and keep “conversation” only as plain English).

4. **Config visibility**

   * No README/.env example for `VERIFY_URL_BASE`.
   * Action: document this (default `http://localhost:3000/onboarding/verify`) so the web app and API agree.

# Possible roadblocks (before we push UI + agentic features)

* **Claims issuance**: You enforce `OrgOwnerOrAdmin`, but there’s no doc on how the JWT gets those role claims (B2C custom policy? API issuing roles?). Without that, RBAC will be flaky in non-dev environments.
* **Email provider**: Dev stub only. For production you’ll need SendGrid (or similar) + DKIM/SPF, bounce handling, and a short TTL for verification tokens.
* **Anonymous invite/register endpoints**: Add rate-limits + bot protections (e.g., token entropy + IP throttling) to prevent abuse.
* **Org scoping guard**: Ensure server ignores any client-supplied `OrganizationId` on protected writes and resolves org from the authenticated principal (middleware filter). The docs imply this, but I don’t see a centralized guard write-up.
* **E2E coverage**: You’ll want a single test that runs the whole path (org → invite → register → verify → create contact) to catch drift early.
* **Frontend missing**: Minimal Next.js routes aren’t in the repo yet; that blocks hands-on verification of the happy path.

# Quick doc fixes I recommend (surgical)

* **architecture/UNIFIED\_SCHEMA.md**: add `OrganizationInvitation` and verification fields under User.
* **reference/DATA\_CONTRACT.md**: add the five onboarding endpoints with request/response shapes and error codes.
* **README + .env.example**: add `VERIFY_URL_BASE` and example.
* **architecture/EMMA-AI-ARCHITECTURE-GUIDE.md** (and a few others): replace `ConversationId` with `InteractionId` in examples.

# Suggested next steps (code + docs)

1. Scaffold the minimal UI (`frontend/web`): `/join/[token]`, `/onboarding/verify`, `/contacts/new`.
2. Add an E2E test script that walks the full invite→verify→contact flow.
3. Wire a production email sender (SendGrid) behind `IEmailSender` with env-driven config.
4. Document the **roles claim issuance** path so RBAC is reproducible in any environment.
5. Do the small doc patches above—happy to draft them if you want them ready to paste.

If you want, say “draft the doc patches,” and I’ll generate exact markdown inserts for those four files.
