# Technical Debt and Design Decisions

Document all technical debt, design decisions, and architectural notes here for the Emma AI Platform. Reference related TODOs as needed.

- Example: Legacy privacy/business logic tags ('CRM', 'PERSONAL', 'PRIVATE') are still present on Contact entities for backward compatibility. See TODO.md for migration tracking.
- Example: Secrets are still managed via docker-compose.yml due to migration risk. See TODO.md for future migration plan.
