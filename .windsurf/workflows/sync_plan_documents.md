   - Identify `EMMA-Unified-Project-Management-Plan.md` as the primary source of truth for project management.

2. **Regular Synchronization**
   - Schedule synchronization at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly).

3. **Automated Syncing**
   - Implement a script or tool to automate the synchronization process if possible.

4. **Maintain Change Logs**
   - Keep a change log in both documents to track updates and identify synchronization needs.

5. **Cross-Reference Changes**
   - Ensure changes in `plan.md` are cross-referenced in the unified plan and vice versa.

6. **Communication**
   - Inform stakeholders about the synchronization process and which document serves as the primary reference.

7. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review the synchronization process and adjust as needed to improve efficiency and accuracy.
