# Emma.Web

This is the React frontend for manual data entry and emulation of user interaction for the Emma platform. It allows you to:
- Select an organization and agent
- Enter client info and message content/type (conversation, text, email, note)
- Submit records to the backend API for testing and emulation purposes

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install` in this directory to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to launch the development server.

The app will connect to your Emma.Api backend endpoints (ensure CORS is enabled for local development).
